**Data Cleansing & Transformation (SQL)**

To create the necessary data model for doing analysis and fulfilling the business needs defined in the user stories the following tables were extracted using SQL.

One data source (sales budgets) were provided in Excel format and were connected in the data model in a later step of the process.

Below are the SQL statements for cleansing and transforming necessary data.

**DIM Calender:**

`SELECT 
  [DateKey], 
  [FullDateAlternateKey] AS Date, 
  [EnglishDayNameOfWeek] AS Day, 
  [WeekNumberOfYear] AS WeekNum,
  [EnglishMonthName] AS Month, 
  LEFT([EnglishMonthName],3) AS MonthShort,
  [MonthNumberOfYear] AS MonthNum, 
  [CalendarQuarter] AS Quarter, 
  [CalendarYear] AS Year
FROM 
  [AdventureWorksDW2019].[dbo].[DimDate]
WHERE
  CalendarYear >= 2019
`

**DIM Customer:**

`SELECT 
  [CustomerKey] AS [Customer Key], 
  C.[FirstName] AS [First Name], 
  [LastName] AS [Last Name], 
  [BirthDate] AS [BirthDate], 
  CASE C.MaritalStatus WHEN 'M' THEN 'Married' WHEN 'S' THEN 'Single' END AS [Marital Status], 
  CASE C.Gender WHEN 'M' THEN 'Male' WHEN 'F' THEN 'Female' END AS [Gender], 
  [YearlyIncome] AS AnnualIncome, 
  [TotalChildren], 
  [EnglishEducation] AS Education, 
  [EnglishOccupation] AS Occupation, 
  CASE C.HouseOwnerFlag WHEN 1 THEN 'YES' WHEN 0 THEN 'NO' END AS [House Owner], 
  [NumberCarsOwned] AS NoOfCars, 
  [DateFirstPurchase], 
  [CommuteDistance], 
  g.City AS CustomerCity 
FROM 
  dbo.DimCustomer c 
  LEFT JOIN dbo.DimGeography as g ON g.GeographyKey = c.GeographyKey 
ORDER BY 
  CustomerKey ASC;
`

**DIM Products:**

`SELECT 
  p.[ProductKey], 
  p.[ProductAlternateKey] AS ProductItemCode, 
  p.[EnglishProductName] AS [Product Name], 
  ps.EnglishProductSubcategoryName AS [Sub Category], 
  pc.EnglishProductCategoryName AS [Product Category],
  p.[Color] as [Product Color],
  p.[Size] AS [Product Size],
  p.[ProductLine] AS [Product Line],
  p.[ModelName] AS [Product Model Name], 
  p.[EnglishDescription] AS [Product Description],
  ISNULL(p.[Status], 'Outdated') AS [Product Status] 
FROM 
  dbo.DimProduct p 
  LEFT JOIN dbo.DimProductSubcategory as ps ON ps.ProductSubcategoryKey = p.ProductSubcategoryKey 
  LEFT JOIN dbo.DimProductCategory as pc ON ps.ProductCategoryKey = pc.ProductCategoryKey 
ORDER BY 
  p.ProductKey;
`

**FACT_InternetSales:**

`SELECT 
  s.[ProductKey], 
  s.[OrderDateKey], 
  s.[DueDateKey], 
  s.[ShipDateKey], 
  s.[CustomerKey], 
  s.[SalesTerritoryKey], 
  st.SalesTerritoryCountry, 
  s.[SalesOrderNumber], 
  s.[SalesAmount] 
FROM 
  dbo.FactInternetSales s 
  JOIN dbo.DimSalesTerritory st on s.SalesTerritoryKey = st.SalesTerritoryKey 
WHERE 
  LEFT(s.OrderDateKey, 4) >= YEAR(GETDATE())-2 --to get data only 2 years before data extraction
ORDER BY 
  OrderDateKey ASC;
`


**Data Model**

Below is a screenshot of the data model after cleansed and prepared tables were read into Power BI.

This data model also shows how FACT_Budget hsa been connected to FACT_InternetSales and other necessary DIM tables.
